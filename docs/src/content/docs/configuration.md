title: Main Configuration
description: Detailed guide to configuring SmartSpawner plugin settings
---

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the `config.yml` file for the SmartSpawner plugin. The configuration file allows you to customize various aspects of the plugin's behavior, from spawner properties to economy settings and visual effects.

## Time Format Guide

The plugin uses a flexible time format for durations:

- **Simple formats**: `20s` (20 seconds), `5m` (5 minutes), `1h` (1 hour)
- **Complex format**: `1d_2h_30m_15s` (1 day, 2 hours, 30 minutes, 15 seconds)
- **Units**: `s` = seconds, `m` = minutes, `h` = hours, `d` = days, `w` = weeks, `mo` = months, `y` = years

## Adding Custom Language

To add a custom language:

1. Create a new folder in the language directory.
2. Use files from `en_US` as templates.
3. Modify `messages.yml`, `formatting.yml`, etc.
4. Set `language` to your custom folder name.

## Language Settings

```yaml
# Language setting (available: en_US, vi_VN, de_DE, en_US_DonutSMP, en_US_DonutSMP_v2)
language: en_US

# Spawner GUI layout configuration (available: default, DonutSMP)
gui_layout: default

# Enable or disable debug mode (provides verbose console output)
debug: false
```

- **language**: Sets the language for plugin messages. Available options: `en_US`, `vi_VN`, `de_DE`, `en_US_DonutSMP`, and `en_US_DonutSMP_v2`.
- **gui_layout**: Chooses the layout for the spawner GUI. Options are `default` and `DonutSMP`.
- **debug**: Enables debug mode for detailed console output, useful for troubleshooting.

## Core Spawner Properties

```yaml
spawner_properties:
  default:
    # Spawn Parameters - Controls mob generation frequency and amounts
    min_mobs: 1         # Minimum mobs spawned per cycle
    max_mobs: 4         # Maximum mobs spawned per cycle
    range: 16           # Player proximity required for activation (in blocks)
    delay: 25s          # Base delay between spawn cycles

    # Storage Settings - Defines internal inventory capacity
    max_storage_pages: 1  # Each page provides 45 inventory slots
    max_stored_exp: 1000  # Maximum experience points that can be stored
    max_stack_size: 10000  # Maximum number of spawners that can be stacked

    # Behavior Settings - Controls special spawner functionality
    allow_exp_mending: true   # Allow spawners to repair items with stored XP
    protect_from_explosions: true   # Protect spawner blocks from explosion
```

These settings define the default behavior for all spawners:

- **Spawn Parameters**:
  - `min_mobs` / `max_mobs`: Range of mobs spawned per cycle.
  - `range`: Distance in blocks a player must be within for the spawner to activate.
  - `delay`: Time between spawn cycles.

- **Storage Settings**:
  - `max_storage_pages`: Number of inventory pages (45 slots each).
  - `max_stored_exp`: Maximum XP that can be stored.
  - `max_stack_size`: Maximum spawners that can be stacked together.

- **Behavior Settings**:
  - `allow_exp_mending`: Enables repairing items using stored XP.
  - `protect_from_explosions`: Prevents spawner blocks from being destroyed by explosions.

## Spawner Breaking Mechanics

```yaml
spawner_break:
  enabled: true         # Master switch for spawner breaking feature

  # Whether to directly add spawner items to player inventory instead of dropping them on the ground
  direct_to_inventory: false

  # Tool Requirements - Which tools can break spawners
  required_tools:
    - IRON_PICKAXE
    - GOLDEN_PICKAXE
    - DIAMOND_PICKAXE
    - NETHERITE_PICKAXE

  # Durability impact on tools when breaking a spawner
  durability_loss: 1    # Number of durability points deducted

  # Enchantment Requirements for successful spawner collection
  silk_touch:
    required: true      # Whether Silk Touch is needed to obtain spawners
    level: 1            # Minimum level of Silk Touch required
```

Controls how players can break and collect spawners:

- `enabled`: Toggles the breaking feature.
- `direct_to_inventory`: Adds spawners directly to inventory instead of dropping.
- `required_tools`: List of tools that can break spawners.
- `durability_loss`: Durability points lost per break.
- `silk_touch`: Requires Silk Touch enchantment to collect spawners.

## Spawner Limitations

```yaml
spawner_limits:
  # Maximum number of spawners (including stacks) allowed per chunk
  # Set to -1 for unlimited spawners per chunk
  # Each spawner in a stack counts toward the limit (not just 1 per stack)
  # Example: 1 spawner with 64 stack + 1 spawner with 6 stack = 70 total count in chunk
  max_per_chunk: -1
```

- `max_per_chunk`: Limits the number of spawners per chunk. Set to `-1` for unlimited.

## Natural/Vanilla Spawner Settings

```yaml
natural_spawner:
  # Whether natural spawners can be broken and collected
  breakable: false

  # Convert natural spawners to smart spawners when broken
  # If false, natural spawners will drop vanilla spawner items
  convert_to_smart_spawner: false

  # Whether natural spawners will spawn mobs
  spawn_mobs: true

  # Whether natural spawner block will be protected from explosions
  protect_from_explosions: false
```

Settings for naturally generated dungeon spawners:

- `breakable`: Allows breaking natural spawners.
- `convert_to_smart_spawner`: Converts natural spawners to SmartSpawners when broken.
- `spawn_mobs`: Enables mob spawning from natural spawners.
- `protect_from_explosions`: Protects natural spawners from explosions.

## Economy Settings

```yaml
custom_economy:
  # Enable or disable selling items from spawners
  enabled: true

  # Supported types: VAULT, COINSENGINE (more will be added in the future)
  currency: VAULT

  # Specifies the name of the currency used by COINSENGINE
  # This setting is only required when using COINSENGINE as the economy currency
  coinsengine_currency: coins

  # Price source modes (see detailed explanations below)
  price_source_mode: SHOP_PRIORITY

  # Shop plugin integration
  shop_integration:
    enabled: true
    # Supported shop plugins: auto, EconomyShopGUI, EconomyShopGUI-Premium, ShopGUIPlus, zShop, ExcellentShop
    preferred_plugin: auto

  # Custom sell price configuration
  custom_prices:
    enabled: true
    price_file_name: "item_prices.yml"
    default_price: 1.0
```

Configures the economy system for selling spawner items:

- `enabled`: Toggles economy features.
- `currency`: Economy plugin to use (`VAULT` or `COINSENGINE`).
- `coinsengine_currency`: Currency name for CoinsEngine.
- `price_source_mode`: Determines how prices are sourced (see below).
- `shop_integration`: Integrates with shop plugins.
- `custom_prices`: Uses custom price file for selling.

### Price Source Modes

- **SHOP_ONLY**: Uses only shop integration prices.
- **SHOP_PRIORITY**: Prefers shop prices, falls back to custom.
- **CUSTOM_ONLY**: Uses only custom prices.
- **CUSTOM_PRIORITY**: Prefers custom prices, falls back to shop.

## Item Collection System

```yaml
hopper:
  enabled: false
  check_delay: 3s       # Time between collection checks
  stack_per_transfer: 5 # Number of item stacks transferred in one operation (max 5)
```

- `enabled`: Enables automatic item collection.
- `check_delay`: Frequency of collection checks.
- `stack_per_transfer`: Stacks transferred per operation.

## Loot Generation Settings

```yaml
loot_generation:
  # Enables hybrid loot generation.
  #
  # The plugin will switch between exact simulation
  # and fast approximation automatically.
  #
  # Recommended: true
  approximate_loot: true

  # Controls when approximation mode starts.
  #
  # Lower values = better performance
  # Higher values = better accuracy
  #
  # Recommended: 1000-10000
  approximation_threshold: 1000
```

Controls how SmartSpawner generates loot for stacked spawners.

- `approximate_loot`: Enables the hybrid loot generation system.  
  SmartSpawner automatically switches between exact binomial simulation and a fast approximation algorithm for very large mob counts.

- `approximation_threshold`: Multiplier that controls how aggressively approximation mode is used.  
  Lower values improve performance, while higher values preserve statistical accuracy for rare drops.

When approximation mode is enabled, the plugin skips expensive per-mob drop simulation and instead calculates loot
using the average loot amount with a small randomized variance (±5%). This drastically reduces CPU usage for extremely large stacked spawners
while still producing realistic loot distributions over time.

Approximation mode is enabled when:
`mobCount > (97.5 / dropChancePercent) * approximationThreshold`

### Recommended Values

| Threshold  | Behavior                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| `10-100`   | Aggressive optimization           |
| `100-1000` | Balanced performance and accuracy |
| `1000+`    | Maximum statistical accuracy      |

### Examples

| Drop Chance | Threshold | Approximate Activation Point |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| `1%`        | `1000`    | `~97,500 mobs`               |
| `0.1%`      | `1000`    | `~975,000 mobs`              |

## Bedrock Player Support

```yaml
bedrock_support:
  # Enable FormUI for Bedrock players
  # Requires Floodgate plugin to be installed and enabled
  enable_formui: true
```

- `enable_formui`: Shows mobile-friendly form menus to Bedrock Edition players (via [Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/download/#floodgate)) instead of chest GUIs.

## Visual Effects

### Hologram

```yaml
hologram:
  enabled: false        # Show floating text above spawners

  # Position Offset from spawner block center
  offset_x: 0.5
  offset_y: 1.6
  offset_z: 0.5

  # Display Settings
  alignment: CENTER     # Text alignment (CENTER, LEFT, or RIGHT)
  shadowed_text: true   # Apply shadow effect to text
  see_through: false    # Hologram visible through blocks
  transparent_background: false  # Make background fully transparent
```

- `enabled`: Shows floating text above spawners.
- `offset_*`: Position adjustments relative to the spawner block center.
- `alignment`: Text alignment — `CENTER`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT`.
- `shadowed_text`: Applies a shadow effect to the text.
- `see_through`: Hologram visible through blocks.
- `transparent_background`: Makes the hologram background fully transparent.

### Particles

```yaml
particle:
  spawner_stack: true           # Show effects when spawners are stacked
  spawner_activate: true        # Show effects when spawner activates
  spawner_generate_loot: true   # Show effects when items are generated
```

Toggles particle effects for various spawner actions.

## Spawner Action Logging

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: true
  json_format: false      # false = human-readable, true = JSON structured logs
  console_output: false
  log_directory: "logs"

  # Server identifier for cross-server setups (must be unique per server)
  server_name: "server1"

  # Show all servers in /smartspawner list (only works with MYSQL)
  sync_across_servers: false

  # Auto-migrate from local storage on startup
